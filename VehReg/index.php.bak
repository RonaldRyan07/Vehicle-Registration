            Apart from vehicle registration or vahan registration, RTO is responsible for issuing driving licences, inspect vehicle insurance, and keep a tab of pollution created by vehicles.
            The RTO assigns a permanent registration number to your vehicle that you will not be allowed to change under any circumstances. 
            As soon as you buy the vehicle, the dealer will assign a temporary registration number which is usually valid for a month.
            Within one month, you should get a permanent registration number for your vehicle.
